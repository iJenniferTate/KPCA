# # KAPTEN Campaign Analysis - Promocode
# 
# The objective of this project is to understand whether a ride promocode marketing campaign by Kapten was "good" & worthwhile. The promocode was emailed only to current users of Kapten. It multiplied loyalty points accumulated during this period by 5 times. Users are grouped by: Red  (0) Silver (1) Gold (2) Platinum (3) loyalty statuses, where each number is points per euro spent.  
# 
# The campaign ocurred from the 17th to the 21st of May. Data used is from a random subset of its ride data which has been altered for privacy purposes.   
# 
# If it was a good campaign, the company will have gained a ROI return on investment of around 25 - 50%: a range which current [marketing industry standards](https://themarketingsquare.com/2012/04/whats-a-good-advertising-roi/) would consider large enough to be worthwhile. For objectivity, results are benchmarked against the industry standard.

# **Assumes Loyalty_points_earned column not needed per instructions stating: "the bonus points were credited with an adhoc script after the end of the campaign & additionnal points cannot be seen in the data set
# 
# **Given other_coupon_action implies coupon claimed. Note: coupon_created rows not available (to investigate.)
